Block Diagrams are used to visualize, simulate, and develop dynamic systems. They are an expanded view of a mathematical equation.

In control, there are many techniques used to manipulate block diagrams. The table below shows commonly used techniques.

When simplifying a closed loop block diagram with no coefficient in the feedback loop, Simply add the numerator of the function to the denominator. e.g $k(s)$ in an empty closed feedback loop would become $\frac{K(s)}{1+K(s)}$ . So it's just 7. in the table above but you H(s) is 1. And 1 represents the original denominator before the loop was solved.
