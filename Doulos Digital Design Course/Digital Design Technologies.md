IC = Integrated Circuit

The main cost for creating custom ICs comes from setting up the factory to build the ICs in the first place, which must be done before any are made. From there it's just the cost of the individual silicon wafers, which is quite small.

DFT = Design for Test

BIST = Built in self test

SRAM FPGA: 

| Pros                          | Cons                                                |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| High density                  | Requires external programming at startup, e.g flash |
| Reprogrammable                | Lower reliability in safety critical situations     |
| No Hardware Programmer needed |                                                     |

Non-volatile FPGA:

| Pros         | Cons               |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| Reliable     | Not reprogrammable |
| Confidential | Smaller Capacity   |
