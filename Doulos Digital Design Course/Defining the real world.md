The safe area in the real world lies in synchronous design.

Metastability: when the flip flop is set to a value that is neither 1 nor 0. The flip flop will eventually converge to one or the other.

Metastability is unavoidable. But you can limit it by registering each asynchronous input twice.

During the clock edge the flip flop operates in a state of metastability.
